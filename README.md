# Qualtrics_SiteIntercept_Py
Sample Python code to extract Survey Impressions from Qualtrics API 

## How to use this code:

* Install required Packages
* Update the Survey SiteIntercept IDs in the Code
* Update Qualtrics User ID and its token in the code
* Execute/Run the code to get your tabular results printed 

**Caveats:** 
* Please make sure the Qualtrics ID and token used in the code has access to SiteIntercept Data 
* This code is compatible with Python version 2.x.x  

## Future Development:

* Extracting *Clicks* (another metric that SiteIntercept provides) along with *impressions*
* Adding alternate code for Python 3.x.x compatibility
* Ability to extract Historic Data
* Plotting Trends
